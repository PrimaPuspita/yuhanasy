Halo again, I'm Yuhanas. Actually I'm a bit shy to introduce my self, and of course it's always hard to describe myself but, yeah here we go 🤗. I'm a part of software engineer [@eFishery](https://efishery.com/), and I'm mostly doing frontend development. What I'm working on right now is developing some web apps for our end user as well as for our internal platform. I live in Bandung, Indonesia 🇮🇩.


##### Want to know some fun facts ❓
- 👷🏼‍♂️ I'm not coming from CS degree, once I was a geophysical engineering student, haha
- 👼🏻 I always wear XS or kids clothes
- 🧍‍♂️ I'm (still) available
- 😭 There are not many codes in my github, because I mostly work in another place
- 🧠 I want to learn a lot of things, but often get overhelmed with my over-excitement
- 🧬 and, I will keep learning. Well this one is not fun fact, but it's fun...


##### You know that it's important to have hobby or hobbies, so, here are the list what I'm interested in:
1. 📖 Islamic studies, aqidah, manhaj, fiqh
2. 🌱 Plants, gardening, farming
3. 😻 Animal, cat
4. 👨🏻‍💻 Programming
5. 🏡 Architecture, interior design
6. 🏞 Graphic design, art
7. 📱 Tech, gadget
8. 🚀 Rocket, aviation
9. 🌏 Nature, earth science
10. ⚒ Crafting, DIY, woodworking
11. 📸 Photography, videography
12. ...

> Needless to say that I’m also interested with woman. So don’t ask why 🙈

### **Too much, but it’s okay, it’s exciting. The only problem is it’s just 24 hours a day.**


...and, hey before you left, I want you to know that I reeaaaaally want to collaborate with many people out there, learning and gaining experiences with them. If any of you want to share knowledge and experience with me, contact me please. End of FYI. 🥱
